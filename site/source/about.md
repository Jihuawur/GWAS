### The Lab
Located at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA, we are dedicated to the understanding and development of statistical methods in the realm of genomic data. Collaborating with investigators across multiple disciplines ranging from oncology to immunology, we investigate techniques for analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and disease outcomes, while considering the complex correlation structure of the human genome. Notably, we are interested in determining the association of biomarkers and given regions of the genome such as genes, lincRNAs, enhancer elements and other biologically relevant topologies. With the ever-changing knowledge of the functionaility of DNA, we believe it is essential to find appropriate and reproducible analytic methods for determining true causes of disease, and are committed to improving this process.

### Andrea S. Foulkes, Sc.D

Dr. Foulkes is an Associate Professor of Statistics at Mount Holyoke College. Her research includes developing analytic methods for characterizing the relationships among high-dimensional molecular and cellular data and measures of disease progression. These methods draw from cluster analysis, recursive partitioning, mixed effects modeling and Markov modeling. In addition, Dr. Foulkes is working on establishing methods for understanding the complex relationships among HIV-1 genotypic markers of resistance to antiretroviral drugs, cellular immune modulation and clinical outcomes.

Foulkes received a B.A. in Mathematics from Brown University in 1994 and an Sc.D. in Biostatistics from Harvard School of Public Health in 2000.

### Jing Qian Ph.D

Dr. Qian's main research interests are in the area of survival analysis, which deals with time-to-event data in general. Specifically, he studies semiparametric methods for correlated time-to-event outcomes, arising from medical cost and cost-effectiveness analysis and multistate clinical trials. By developing a quantile regression approach for censored survival data, Dr. Qian introduces flexible modeling methods to deal with non-constant covariate effects in regression. Currently, he is also active in developing statistical methods for survival data subject to complex sampling. In addition, he is interested in statistical inference with high dimensional data. His other research interests include statistical issues in clinical trials and epidemiological studies, and statistical analysis in neurologic diseases.

Dr. Qian received his B.S. from Renmin University of China in 2002 and his Ph.D. from Emory University in 2009.

Sara has been a Research Scientist under Dr. Foulkes since January 2014. As a recent graduate from the Biostatistics Master's program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, she is interested in developing her statistical genetic understanding and mentoring undergraduates who are interested in the same field before she returns to school for her Ph.D. Her work has included developing teaching modules for statistical learning in R as well as conducting genetic association analyses utilizing both existing and novel methods. While she is intrigued by any health related resarch, she is most interested in the genetics of chronic disease. 

Ms. Nuñez graduated from Boston College with a B.A. in Mathematics in 2013, and received her M.S. in Biostatistics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst School of Public Health in 2015.
